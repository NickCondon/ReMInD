# ReMInD User Guide

## Overview
ReMInD helps researchers capture essential metadata for imaging experiments, generating structured ReadMe.txt files and JSON exports for research data management.

## Getting Started

### First Launch
When you first open ReMInD, you may see a template selection dialog:
- **Select a template** to pre-fill common fields
- **Skip** to start with a blank form
- This module runs when a file ending with `*ReadMe_template.txt` is present in the same location as the executable

### Interface Layout
- **Form fields** - Left column labels, right column inputs
- **Metadata panel** - Shows extracted image metadata
- **Control buttons** - Generate, Load, Clear, Help, etc.
- **Font controls** - A+/A- buttons to adjust text size

## Core Features

### 1. Manual Data Entry
Fill in relevant fields:
- **Experiment name** - Title of your experiment
- **Date and time** - Use "Now" button for current timestamp
- **Sample information** - Cell lines, animal strains, etc.
- **Microscope settings** - Objective, immersion, imaging mode
- **Notes** - Detailed experimental context

**Tips:**
- Hover over fields for help tooltips
- Not all fields are required
- Use dropdown menus where available
- Choose "Other" and specify in Notes if needed

### 2. Automatic Metadata Extraction

#### Supported File Formats
- **CZI files** (Zeiss) - Acquisition settings, channels, objectives
- **LIF files** (Leica) - System details, imaging parameters  
- **ND2 files** (Nikon) - Experimental setup, time series, Z-stacks

#### How to Extract Metadata
1. Click **"Load Fields from Image File"**
2. Select your image file (CZI, LIF, or ND2)
3. Review the automatically populated fields
4. Check the "Extracted Image Metadata" panel
5. Add additional experimental context as needed

#### What Gets Extracted (where possible)
- Date and time of acquisition
- Microscope name and model
- Objective lens specifications
- Channel information and labels
- Z-stack and time series settings
- Software and system information

### 3. File Operations

#### Generate ReadMe.txt
1. Complete your form
2. Click **"Generate ReadMe.txt"**
3. Choose save location (preferably with your data)
4. File includes both form data (including notes) and extracted metadata (if used)

#### Load Existing ReadMe
1. Click **"Load ReadMe.txt"**
2. Select a previously generated file
3. Form repopulates for editing/updating
4. Extracted metadata should be restored if present

#### Export as JSON
1. Click **"Export as JSON"**
2. Creates structured data file
3. Includes both form entries and raw metadata
4. Useful for data processing workflows

### 4. Templates

#### Using Templates
- Templates automatically load at startup
- Choose from available options or skip
- Pre-fills common information (name, RDM info, etc.)

#### Creating Templates
1. Fill out a form with common information
2. Generate ReadMe.txt
3. Rename file to `*_ReadME_template.txt`
4. Place in same folder as ReMInD executable
5. Will appear in template selection at startup

## Best Practices

### Suggested File Organization
```
/Your_Experiment_Folder/
├── raw_data/
│   ├── image001.czi
│   ├── image002.czi
│   └── ...
├── Experiment_ReadMe.txt     ← Generated by ReMInD
├── Experiment_metadata.json  ← Optional JSON export
└── analysis/
    └── ...
```

### Workflow Recommendations

#### New Experiment
1. **Load image metadata first** - Extract from your first acquired image
2. **Review and supplement** - Check imported data for accuracy
3. **Add experimental context** - Sample prep, environmental conditions
4. **Save ReadMe** - Use descriptive filename with experiment name
5. **Store with data** - Keep ReadMe.txt with raw images

#### Ongoing Experiments
1. **Load previous ReadMe** - Use as starting point for similar experiments
2. **Update differences** - Modify only what's changed
3. **Version control** - Use filenames like `ReadMe_exp1_v1.txt`, `ReadMe_exp1_v2.txt`
4. **Consistent naming** - Develop a laboratory naming convention or use standard ontologies for your discipline

#### Multi-user Labs
1. **Create lab templates** - Standard templates with common equipment/settings
2. **Share templates** - Distribute `*_ReadME_template.txt` files
3. **Standardize fields** - Agree on controlled vocabulary usage
4. **Training** - Ensure all users understand metadata importance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to extract metadata"
- **Cause**: Unsupported file format or corrupted file
- **Solution**: Check file format (CZI/LIF/ND2 only), try different file

#### Template not appearing
- **Cause**: Incorrect filename or location
- **Solution**: Ensure filename ends with `_ReadME_template.txt` and is in same folder as executable

#### Window too large/small
- **Cause**: Screen resolution issues
- **Solution**: Use A+/A- buttons to adjust font size, resize window manually

#### Missing fields after loading ReadMe
- **Cause**: File format changes between versions  
- **Solution**: Manually re-enter missing information

### Getting Help
- Click **"Help"** button in application for built-in assistance
- Check GitHub Issues for known problems
- Contact IMB Microscopy for University of Queensland users
