## 📖 Overview

This tool assists researchers in capturing and organizing essential metadata for imaging experiments. It generates a structured `ReadME.txt` file that can be stored alongside raw data to support good research data management (RDM) practices and future reuse.

The tool is especially useful for users of light microscopy and other imaging systems, helping to ensure that contextual information is not lost after acquisition.
